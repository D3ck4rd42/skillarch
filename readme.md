## TODO

- Document aliases & tools
- Verify install process
- Add CICD daily builds
- nvim auto transparency with https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/116#discussioncomment-11108106
- Hide golang storage in home, change basedir
- pacman on must reinstall vlc
- omz plugin check before enable (slowww)
- alias docker php 7 broken libs lulz

## git-based + link config management

- home current config files if present AND not links must be moved to .bak
- home links to /opt/skillarch/config/...
- update alias must make pull (error out on dirty state, take care of home & main branches only) && make install && make rebase
